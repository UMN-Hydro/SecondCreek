The elevation useed to calibrate sg1_4_161005161403_H2366_FirstPlacement was estimated, not surveyed. 
In my analysis, this was corrected for AFTER head differences were calculated for 1DtempPro. If a 
a more certain stream head TS for the first placement of the SG is required, it can be backed out
of one of one of the shifted dh TS.
