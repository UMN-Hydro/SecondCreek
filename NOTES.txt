-found depth to stream, casing length for PZ. Put them into python file
- Trying to sort out confusion with DiverElev in SCDiver_calc. There is a line in the script where DiverElev is calculated, but there are also
 spots where it is manally inputted. I beilive the manual inputs should override the calculation where the manual input is available. Where
did I get the values for the manual inputs? And were the head ts for each 2016 PZ calculated using the correct diver depth (ie manual input, not calc)

- I believe that the head difference TS for PZCC and SG-1 was calculated using the appropriate PZ elevation information
- JUST KIDDING the head difference doesnt make any sense- the second half of the summer is much maller
