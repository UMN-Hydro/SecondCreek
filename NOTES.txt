- updated second creek git repo by removing larg efiles with filter-branch

-found depth to stream, casing length for PZ. Put them into python file
- Trying to sort out confusion with DiverElev in SCDiver_calc. There is a line in the script where DiverElev is calculated, but there are also
 spots where it is manally inputted. I beilive the manual inputs should override the calculation where the manual input is available. Where
did I get the values for the manual inputs? And were the head ts for each 2016 PZ calculated using the correct diver depth (ie manual input, not calc)

- I believe that the head difference TS for PZCC and SG-1 was calculated using the appropriate PZ elevation information
- JUST KIDDING the head difference doesnt make any sense- the second half of the summer is much maller. I suspect that there is something
 wrong with the SG surveyed elevation... such an normous change in head at the JULY discontinuitty
- deciding to restrict analysis to the first half of summer until a procedure is developed, then address the sg discrepancy
- head differenc is applied to top and bottom sensors - this needs to be scaled. 
- scaled head diff
-1d temp pro gives error on 3rd iteration: could the parameters be physically unrealistic???
- attempt to isolate error by running model withgeneric sediment parameters -still gives an error. I wonder If I have a sign wrong in the head difference?I guess the head difference calculations need to be checked again.
