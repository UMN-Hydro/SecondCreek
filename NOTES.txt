-Reorganized SecondCreekGit repo
- attempted to commit (fail)


10/21 
- updated second creek git repo by removing larg efiles with filter-branch


10/24
-found depth to stream, casing length for PZ. Put them into python file
- Trying to sort out confusion with DiverElev in SCDiver_calc. There is a line in the script where DiverElev is calculated, but there are also
 spots where it is manally inputted. I beilive the manual inputs should override the calculation where the manual input is available. Where
did I get the values for the manual inputs? And were the head ts for each 2016 PZ calculated using the correct diver depth (ie manual input, not calc)

10/25
- I believe that the head difference TS for PZCC and SG-1 was calculated using the appropriate PZ elevation information
- JUST KIDDING the head difference doesnt make any sense- the second half of the summer is much maller. I suspect that there is something
 wrong with the SG surveyed elevation... such an normous change in head at the JULY discontinuitty
- deciding to restrict analysis to the first half of summer until a procedure is developed, then address the sg discrepancy
- head differenc is applied to top and bottom sensors - this needs to be scaled. 
- scaled head diff
-1d temp pro gives error on 3rd iteration: could the parameters be physically unrealistic???
- attempt to isolate error by running model withgeneric sediment parameters -still gives an error. I wonder If I have a sign wrong in the head difference?I guess the head difference calculations need to be checked again.

10/25
make sure github worked
10/30
-In the past few days: Github issue with commited archive files was resolved
- couldnt get a meaningful resuplt from 1d temp b/c I forgot to multiply the head difference by a factor of -1. The program was throwing several errors.

10/31
-Ran 1d temp using PZCC head data. TPA is still an outlier, with K an order of magnitue smaller that B and C. Re running TPA using the PZI head difference instead. Stay tuned:
- still only considering summer up to aug 1. I wonder what happens if entire summer considered!?
- should sg1 be used to calc dh for PZI? PZI isnt in the stream...?

11/4
- to do:
	-rerun temp probe for second half of summer
	- qantify how results for K correspond with results for average q
	- document how each dh time series was calculated
	- check location of each TP with amandas notes
	- BACK CALCULATE DS FOR FIRST HALF OF SUMMER FROM SECND HALF RESULTS
Issues:
	-There isnt temperature data past 8/1/16 for TPB and TPC. I checked both google drives.
Point of intrest:
	-There is one brief head inversion in the second half of the summer aproc 8/29
		
TEMP PRO results 
	 -K slightly larger for second half of summer using TPA (Makes sense because dh/ds is smaller in the second half

11/6
-Error  caught: PZI and PZCW length was in meters, not CM. All K values previously modeled dHCW and dhI from those TS should be thrown out.
- Encountering confusion about all units. headdiff files have units meters (SCDiver gives units of cm, then converted to M in HeadDiffcalc)
-There were unit errors in the calculations for all dh time series, all K modeling must be repeated. 
- rerunning all k esitamtions, getting k several orders of magnitude smaller. New results agree with independently modeled q

11/7


-to do: shift PZI and PZCC head series using same method as PZCW
- document shift method clearly
-reestimate k for tpb, tpc
- make q time series plots
- for meeting with Crystal tomorrow: 
- signed honors form
- sg1 back calc
- q ts plot based on K and new dh/ds (from back calc q)

11/16/17
- re-running K estimation with shifted data to be able to observe at quality of fit
		-Archive 50: full summer TPA,  51 amd 52 are TPC and TPB
-made full summer q ts plots
-took screenshots to compare fits visualy
11/19/17
- wrote script to get logger data into proper format for scdiver
-need surveyed elevation and dtw for 2017 to calibrate loggers
- working on formating temp data


- what is elevation of survey stations?
for meeting:
-screenshots to show fit comparison
- q ts plots

QUESTIONS
-when were harsh's measurments taken? early oct 7
-was the sg moved? - see NEW sg 6/9
-how do i correlate elevations from independent stations? based on unique wells

-rod height?

11/20
-SCdiver aint working famo
-got elevations calculated all nice and neat
-wtf is up with the 300mb .txt files?
- band pass filtering--how to do????? what is best????/

11/21
-investigating large tp files
-looks like the xtra big tp files were trippled up on data, thatsaid... they are still realllllly huge
-github no like big data files (still) so i put them in my documents for safe keeping
-need to get scdiver working tonight IHOPE
