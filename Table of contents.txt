SCRIPT OUTPUTS
	1D Temp Pro
   		-1DTempPro inpupts and outpus for all 1DtempPro runs in fall 2017, spring 2018
	
	Head ts for 1dtemppro
		Head_differences, no scaling
		-difference in head between each PZ and the stream gauge, files with "1" are first half of summer, files with "2" are second half of summer
		Scaled using PZStickup
		-head difference between each PZ and the stream gauge, shifted using the method described in "SCALED dh series calculations.txt"
	
	SC_Diver outputs
	-peizometer data with atmospheric pressure subtracted and consistent datum applied, includes plots of head vs time for each PZ

Scripts
	SC_Diver
	-various versions of the SC_Diver script(applies a consistent datum and subtracts atmospheric pressure for each PZ), filepaths in each script will have to be updated
	 
	Tot_head plotting
	-matlab scripts to plot the outputs on SC_Diver, useful for visualizing the head at some or all of the PZ over a period of time
	
	Temp probe calibration
	-matlab scripts for processing raw temperature probe data. These scripts have not been updated for use with the 2017 probes.

	Conjoined q time series and rainfall plot
	- R script to make the plot of hydrologic flux and precipitation with a shared x axis
	
	PReparing head time series for 1Dtemppro
	-One script to correct the head difference time series for the first half of summer where the SG elevation was not measured
	-3 scripts, one for each probe, to scale each head dh/ds time series so that ds = 0.3m (the distance between the top and bottom probes)
	
	Sensitivty plots and data
	- data and R scripts for creating the sensitivity analysis plots in Jack Lange's GSA poster

Presentations and figures
	-figures generated for a variety of presentation
	
	North Central GSA poster
	-figuresfor GSA poster
	-Conjoined_plot_df.Rda is the data for creating the conjoined q and rainfall plot
		Data
		-data for the sensitivity analysis figures generated by SensAnalysis_plot.R (located in Scripts/Sensitivity plots and data)
