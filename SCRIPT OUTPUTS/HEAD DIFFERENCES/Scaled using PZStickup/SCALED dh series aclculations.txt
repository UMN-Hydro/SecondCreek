Assume: SG2 surveyed elevation is correst

estimate K from 1dtemp for second half of summer using TPA
estimate avg q for first half of summer using 1dtemp

assume k is cosnstant in time

calculate q/k to get theoretical average dh/ds

shift factor is the difference between theoretical dh/ds and dh/ds that was calculated from pzcw head - sg1 head
 shift factor * ds gives the head shift that will correct for the mismeasured sg1 elevation
apply head shift to each dh eseries
