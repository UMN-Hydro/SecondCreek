Assume: SG2 surveyed elevation is correct (the elevation of the stream gauge at the end of summer 2016)

estimate K from 1dtemp for second half of summer using TPA
estimate avg q for first half of summer using 1dtemp

assume k is constant in time

calculate q/k to get theoretical average dh/ds

shift factor is the difference between theoretical average dh/ds and avergae dh/ds that was calculated from pzcw head - sg1 head
 
shift factor * ds gives the head shift that will correct for the mismeasured sg1 elevation

apply head shift to each dh series.
