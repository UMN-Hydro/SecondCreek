Column 1 = date

Column 2 = (Head PZ - Head SG)/(PZlength - PZStickup) * -0.3

 PZIstickup was = PZCCstickup - (PZCCelev - PZIelev), and PZCW was calculated in the same fashion (replazinc PZIelev with PZCWelev)

Units are detailed in the script where this calculation takes place (PZI dh clacs.py, PZCW dh calc.py, PZCC dh calcs.py
